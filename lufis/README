This is a modified LUFS daemon, which uses the FUSE kernel module.  It
is binary compatible with existing LUFS filesystems, so no
recompilation is needed.

Licence:

GPL (see COPYING).  Most of the code is copied from the LUFS source
written by Florin Malita <mali@go.ro>, thanks!

Disclaimer:

This is currently just a proof-of-concept implementation, not a
finished product.  That said it seems perfectly stable.  Comments, are
of course welcome <miklos@szeredi.hu>.

Installation:

  - install lufs (0.9.7)
  - install fuse (1.1)
  - enter 'make' in this directory

Usage, for exampe:

  ./lufis fs=sshfs,host=kempelen,username=mszeredi /mnt/lufis/ -s

Don't forget the '-s' option, without it the filesystem may misbehave!

For help on FUSE specific options see:

  ./lufis fs=localfs -h

and 

  ./lufis fs=localfs / -- -h

For LUFS specific options (can only be specified in the first
argument) see the README in the LUFS distribution


Captivefs:

from version 0.2 lufis supports mounting the captivefs.  Command line
should be something like this:

lufis "fs=captivefs,dir_cache_entries=0,image=/store/ntfs/ntfs.img,captive_options=--rw;--load-module=/var/lib/captive/ntoskrnl.exe;--filesystem=/var/lib/captive/ntfs.sys;--sandbox-server=/usr/sbin/captive-sandbox-server;" /mnt/ntfs -s

It may work without the '-s' option, but this is untested.

umounting should be done with 'umount' as root or 'fusermount -u' as
non-root.
