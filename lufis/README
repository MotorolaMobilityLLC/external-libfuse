This is a modified LUFS daemon, which uses the FUSE kernel module.

Disclaimer:

This is currently just a proof-of-concept implementation, not a
finished product.  That said it seems perfectly stable.  Comments, are
welcome at <mszeredi@inf.bme.hu>.

Installation:

  - install lufs (0.9.7)
  - install fuse (1.1)
  - enter 'make' in this directory

Usage, for exampe:

  ./lufis fs=sshfs,host=kempelen,username=mszeredi /mnt/lufis/ -s

The '-s' option is important!

For help on FUSE specific options see:

  ./lufis fs=localfs -h

and 

  ./lufis fs=localfs / -- -h

For LUFS specific options (can only be specified in the first
argument) see the README in the LUFS distribution
