Fuse version 0.01
=================

This is a test release.  It seems to work thus far, but still has a few
iffy areas, as well as a few rough edges.  There will be future
releases.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test  # currently this just makes sure the lib can link
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the FUSE userspace library and the FUSE kernel module.

BUGS

A lot of it works, but I have to do some formal testing on all of it
still.

Building a Linux kernel actually succeeds.  I haven't tried booting it.

The functions, all of which need to be thoroughally tested:
getattr
readlink
getdir
mknod
mkdir
unlink
rmdir
open
read
statfs
symlink
rename
link
chmod
chown
truncate
utime
write

While most things work, I do still have a TODO list:
* while "ln -s" works as expected, "cp -a" kicks out an error on symlinks.
* "du -sb" reports a couple orders of magnitude too large a size.
* need a full Test::Harness framework
