BUGS

I've begun to build a formal testing framework.  Currently it can mount
and unmount loopback.pl, and all of the base-level functions have test
scripts.  These need to be fleshed out as problems are noticed.

The current test framework seems to work well, but the underlying mount/
unmount infrastructure is a crock.  I am not pleased with that code.

While most things work, I do still have a TODO list:
* while "ln -s" works as expected, "cp -a" kicks out an error on symlinks.
* "du -sb" reports a couple orders of magnitude too large a size.
* need to sort out cleaner mount semantics for the test framework
* figure out how to un-linuxcentrify the statfs tests
* test everything on other architectures and OS's
